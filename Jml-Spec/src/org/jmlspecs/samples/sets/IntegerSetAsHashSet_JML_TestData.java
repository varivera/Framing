    // an argument.  There is a library of strategies for generating
    // test data in org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies, which are used in

    // data.  The only requirement is that you implement the methods
    // below.

    // If you change the type being tested in a way that introduces
    // new types of arguments for some methods, then you will have to
    // introduce (by hand) definitions that are similar to the ones
    // below, because jmlunit never rewrites this file.
