    // TEST DATA SUPPLY SECTION

    // You should edit the following code to supply test data.  In the
    // skeleton originally supplied below, the jmlunit tool made a
    // guess as to a minimal strategy for generating test data for
    // each type of object used as a receiver, and each type used as
    // an argument.  There is a library of strategies for generating
    // test data in org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies, which are used in
    // the tool's guesses.  See the documentation for JML and in
    // particular for the org.jmlspecs.jmlunit.strategies package for
    // a general discussion of how to do this.  (This package's
    // documentation is available through the JML.html file in the top
    // of the JML release, and also in the package.html file that
    // ships with the package.)
    //
    // In the code below, you can change the strategies from those
    // that were guessed by the jmlunit tool, and you can also define
    // new ones to suit your needs.  You can also delete any useless
    // sample test data that has been generated for you to show you
    // the pattern of how to add your own test data.  The only
    // requirement is that you implement the methods below.
    //
    // If you change the type being tested in a way that introduces
    // new types of arguments for some methods, then you will have to
    // introduce (by hand) definitions that are similar to the ones
    // below, because jmlunit never rewrites this file.
